# headline-cleaning

This repository holds data and code 
related to the headline cleaning project. 
The first part of the code simplifies the 
problem--can we get dates and words out of 
these files?

The second part will be a bigger request, 
trying to build a `tidy` data set where we
can have all the words associated with 
newspaper and date.
